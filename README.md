Jeff's test website, initially for MusicFlashCards

Currently, this is a GitHub Pages website that holds music flashcards generated by
https://github.com/ReArquitecto/music-generator and manually copied here.

The goal is a website that provides a control panel for the user to make selections
regarding what kinds of flashcards are of interest.  Once selected, a random flashcard
matching the controls is generated.  On some user action, the next random flashcard is
shown.  Optionally, the "user action" is playing the given flashcard (detected via MIDI.)
The average time per flaschard is displayed, as a proxy for a grade or score.
